    Welcome,

if you are here then i am assumeing that you want to use java this year. GREAT!!
I am so glad that you are going to step the game up this year, but it might be diffcult expectaly if you have had no experence with programing.
this is why i would just like to remind you that you can always use mitapp inventor or blocks programing.
both of those work extremely well, so if you dont feal comfortable tell your team NOW and not in the middle
of the season when you have no idea what you are doing.
you should read the other file located in here (readme.md) it has a lot of good information.
if you are ever unshure about something with android stuideos LOOK IT UP.
online is you seconded greatest resource.

your greatest source is the programmer(s) sitting next to you, you are a team so act like one.
that said if yo u have a difficult question hernando is utterely useless, i repeate he dose not know java.
if you do need anything though the programmers on the FTC or FRC capstone will help you, just remind them gracious professionalism.
